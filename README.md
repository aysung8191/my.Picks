SEIR 1212 - Project 2 - my.Picks

# my.Picks
my.Picks is a sports-gambling tips/advice site where users can come to look up game and player stats that are all aggregated in one place, while discussing and comparing their picks with others in the community!

Launch Site Here: https://project2-mypicks.herokuapp.com/

## Site Overview: 
Similar to reddit, my.Picks is a community where fellow sports-gambling enthusiasts can come to discuss picks, share opinions and even debate with each other - all with live updated game and player stats on one page! You'll be able to find opening and current lines, weather conditions, ATS/Over&Under season trends and even a list of injured players - all there to help you make the best decision before placing your bet.

## Next Steps: 
* "Favorite Teams" page - allow users to pre-select their favorite teams so that they can view a page of only the teams they choose to follow, rather than seeing the full schedule of upcoming games.
* Community poll - allow users to make their picks on specific matches and see what side the community is leaning towards.
* Sort/Filter ability on Home Page - allow users to sort matches by 'Sport', 'Team', or 'Date'.
* Implement and utilize API - have stats updating live and have the "injured players" section route to rotowire articles.
* Styling
